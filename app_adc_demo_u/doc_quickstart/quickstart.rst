xCORE-USB ADC demo quick start guide

Quick start guide (app_adc_demo_u)
----------------------------------

This application demonstrates how to use the ADC on xCORE-USB (U-Series)
devices. The demo is designed to run out of the box on the ``USB AUDIO 2.0 DJ KIT``
(XP-SKC-SU1).

The application reads the ADC and prints to the console whenever the ADC value
changes. The ADC input is connected to the potentiometer on the board.

Hardware setup
++++++++++++++

To setup the hardware (:ref:`adc_u_example_hardware_setup`):

    #. Connect the XTAG-2 USB debug adaptor to the DJ KIT board (via the supplied adaptor board)
    #. Connect the XTAG-2 to host PC (via a USB extension cable if desired)
    #. For power, connect the USB connector on the DJ KIT board to the host PC.

   Hardware Setup for U-Series ADC example

Import and build the application
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   #. Open xTIMEcomposer and open the edit perspective (Window->Open Perspective->XMOS Edit).
   #. Locate the ``xCORE-USB ADC Example`` item in the xSOFTip pane on the bottom left
      of the window and drag it into the Project Explorer in the xTIMEcomposer.
      This will also cause the modules on which this application depends (in this case,
      module_xassert, module_logging) to be imported as well. 
   #. Click on the ``app_adc_demo_u`` item in the Project Explorer then click on the
      build icon (hammer) in xTIMEcomposer. Check the Console window to verify that the
      application has built successfully.

Note that the Developer Column in the xTIMEcomposer on the right hand side of your screen
provides information on the xSOFTip components you are using. Select the ``module_usb_tile_support``
component in the Project Explorer, and you will see its description together with API
documentation. Having done this, click the `back` icon until you return to this
quick start guide within the Developer Column.

For help in using xTIMEcomposer, try the xTIMEcomposer tutorial (See Help->Tutorials in xTIMEcomposer).

Run the application
+++++++++++++++++++

Now that the application has been compiled, the next step is to run it on the
board using the tools to load the application over JTAG (via the XTAG-2 Adaptor card)
into the xCORE multicore microcontroller.

   #. Click on the ``app_adc_demo_u`` item in the Project Explorer then click on the
      ``Run`` icon (the white arrow in the green circle). A dialog will appear
      asking which device to connect to. Select ``XMOS XTAG-2``.
   #. The application will start running and print the value of the ADC which should be
      connected to the potentiometer on the board.
   #. Turning the potentiometer will change the value the ADC is reading.

*Note:* every time there is output to the Console window from the application the Console
window is brought to the foreground. To stop the Console window coming to the foreground
simply stop the application using the ``Stop`` button in the Console window (red square).

Next steps
++++++++++

Look at the source and change the application to use 8-bit ADC samples
rather than 32-bit samples.

   #. In the ``Project Explorer`` double click on the ``app_adc_demo_u/src/main.xc``
      to open the main source file.
   #. Change the ADC configuration line from ``ADC_32_BPS`` to ``ADC_8_BPS``.
   #. Save ``main.xc`` and click on the ``Run`` icon. This will cause the application
      to be re-compiled and start running. The values printed on the Console will
      now be in the range 0x0 to 0xFF.
